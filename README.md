Unsupervised Machine Learning - Clustering Techniques


This project focuses on applying unsupervised learning methods, specifically clustering, to identify patterns in datasets. The notebook includes the use of the following techniques:

 K-Means Clustering: Explores data clustering using the K-means algorithm.
 Hierarchical Clustering: Groups data points based on hierarchy.
 Dimensionality Reduction (PCA): Simplifies data features while preserving patterns.
 
Dataset:
 The project uses the Iris dataset, a classic dataset for machine learning, containing measurements of iris flowers.

 Results:
Visualizations of clusters
Insights from applying different clustering algorithms
